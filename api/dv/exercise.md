Imagine you are developing an add-in as a simplified interface to author document properties for custom fields in SharePoint and a backend system that helps process them. After putting specific data into the custom fields via your add-in, a backend process then takes that document and performs some function. Here is what your add-ins does:

- Shows the user the document properties and allows them to edit specific items.
- Allows the user to change specific customer properties.
- Allows the user to Set those properties on a button click
